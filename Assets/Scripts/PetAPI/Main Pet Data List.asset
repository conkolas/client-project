    Description: Sweet miss Gypsy. She is a 6 year old Border collie who could snuggle
      for hours. She enjoys taking walks and is a very good in her kennel! She would
      be a better fit in a home with older children as she likes to be in the middle
      of it all. She is looking for someone to show her attention and she will be
      so happy

    Description: "I have been here a very long time. Humans see me and are scared.
      They say it is because I am a pit bull mix. I rub up against them and give them
      by biggest smile. I love when they talk to me. I just want to be close to them.</p><p>My
      favorite things to do are cuddle and chill on the couch watching movies with
      you. I am 2 years old. </p><p>I like it when there is just me and one human.
      I am a loner and don\xE2\x80\x99t like other cats and dogs much. I am a good
      boy and don\xE2\x80\x99t bark a lot. Please help me find a home."

    Description: Dya is a shy girl who takes a little bit of time to warm up to you.
      She is a silly girl once she breaks her shyness. Dya has a case of the zoomies
      and will spin circles around you. She enjoys her daily walks and romps in the
      yard. She has become quite the snuggler. She would be good in a home with children
      as she lights up when kids come to visit. She will also be a good watch dog
      and tell you when someone is at the door. If you are interested in Dya, you
      will have to come spend some time with her so she can build a trust with you.
      She knows how to sit pretty, shake and lay down. She will also dance on her
      hind legs for a treat.

    Description: Luna is a special girl to us, see she is a tad different but that
      is what makes her so unique and wonderful! She is a young girl at about 2 years
      old, just freshly considered an adult with a teenager attitude and a toddlers
      get up and go play style. This girl is a tall, slender and muscular girl who
      needs an active family or a job to do to keep her energy manageable, she strives
      to please you. When she is not chewing on a bone, running around the yard, begging
      you to take her on a walk (and yes she will carry her leash around the house
      until you take her!) Lu likes her stuffed unicorn, which will go to her new
      home with her, she carries it everywhere she can and sleeps with it in her kennel.
      We do not know her past as she was a rescue transfer after being pulled out
      of a kill shelter, we aren't bothered by not knowing her past because we know
      her present and future are a warm, cozy and forever loved one. <br>This sweet
      girl is good with kids and loves to clean their faces after they make a mess
      from lunch snacks. Due to her play style and her size/strength she may knock
      small ones that are unsteady on their feet down unintentionally. Being dog selective
      makes it a little more difficult for playdates but her preferences are set,
      meaning we will NOT place her in a home that does not take dog selective dog
      seriously and understand to the fullest she may not get along with a particular
      dog. We are unsure of cats but the small amount of time she has shown her foster
      parents that she is too curious about small critters to make us comfortable
      enough to place her in a home with one. If you are a fun, outgoing, active family
      then Luna is your girl!

    Description: Sweet Marcella, she is perfect in every way it is a shock how she
      is not only still with us but has never had genuine interest in making her a
      forever family member. She is fully house trained and crate trained so no messes,
      minus the here and theres she may have while adjusting. She does great with
      other dogs and cats are no mind for her. Children, oh gosh, kids are her forte
      like they are her personal ones, even though she has never had a litter. If
      you want a girl who would love time to run off energy, a girl who wants to be
      the princess in your castle she is awaiting for her king and queen to find her!

    Description: Gunner is a sweet 3 yr old girl who loves to run, enjoys her romps
      around the yard and walking with our volunteers. She is kennel/house trained
      and will greet you with a big smile and a little jump. She has a high prey drive
      so a home with small animals is a no go. We are still testing her with other
      dogs to see how she fairs with them so as of right now a home with no other
      dogs would be best. <br>Gunner is very active and would do well in a home with
      children and a family that has the patience and knowledge for a dog who may
      be hard of hearing. We have done a few tests and the lower pitched sounds she
      seems to either ignore or does not hear. Gunner girl will be spayed before an
      adoption takes place.

    Description: Our Sweet BREEZE is also still waiting for her forever home and family
      !! This girl just loves people and was so excited to get the attention and to
      get out in the snow to play, that she didn't care what we put on her to wear.
      Ha ha !! Breeze loves people and we would love to see her on a farm or a country
      home / acreage. She has had to be independent in her short life that we would
      love to see her have the freedom to roam and explore. Once she knew this was
      her new home and had people to love and care for her, we are sure she would
      stay close by. Breeze is a spay, one and a half year old Chocolate Lab cross
      Shepherd female. If you would like to come and meet her and spend some time
      with her, she is at the rescue in Gregory, SD 605-835-8780

    Description: Fit Bit originally came from Chicago as a confiscation when he was
      found with 3 other dogs containing bite wounds. Mr Bit was awarded to the city
      after being held as owners prisoner for unknown amount of time. He enjoys rolling
      in the grass and loves nothing more to chase the ball and then watch it stay
      still, he hasn't mastered bringing it back yet. He is so loving and can be quite
      the attention hog and loves all other dogs he has met so far. He still has some
      learning to do with proper play etiquette. He plays like a 6 week old puppy
      in a full grown body at times. Fun and love is his middle namr, he also likes
      to stay active! Fit Bit is looking for a home with older kids, his excitement
      will knock small ones over. We haven't tested him with cats so it is unknown
      how he would do.

      be 3 in October and has a lot of puppy left in her. She loves children and jumping
      on the trampoline with them. She is learning her leash manners, loves to walk
      and go running. She is quick to catching on to commands. She does know how to
      sit and stay. She is looking for an active family who will include her in all
      their activities. She loves water as you can see her dipping her paws in the
      water bucket in one of the posted pics.  Awnie will be spayed before an adoption
      takes place.  If you feel Awnie would make a great addition to your family give
