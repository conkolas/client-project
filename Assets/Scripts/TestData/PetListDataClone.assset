    Description: My name is Ms. Molly. I am super sweet and calm. At one time I was
      loved and family dog until I was given away. I wound up lost and no one came
      to find me. I love to play in the yard, I zoom around like a boomerang. I lounge
      in the sun and really I am no bother to anyone. I am definitely a family dog
      with kids of any age. All I want is a home again, like I used to have. Sadly,
      I cannot go to just any home. My new home has to be outside the Sioux City limits.
      See I am not allowed there and I am not quite sure why?!? Please potential adopter
      looking for a rescue dog, please will you give me a second chance?

    Description: Myles is my name and playing is my game! You know how special red-heads
      are? We are a unique bunch. I am an active companion. I love to exercise and
      would be best if my human companion did too. I am young and have a lot to live
      and eager to learn more and more. I would like my new human to be able to take
      me to school as I am a quick learner and am getting better at my commands. I
      think I may even graduate top of the class and make you proud. I am a compact,
      medium-sized bundle of love. Hey, I can only be adopted to a home outside Sioux
      City limits. They have this silly ban there and dogs like me cannot live there.
      I am hoping they change that soon! Hope to meet you soon, human.

      a perfect running partner! Exercise for me is a must, after all I have to keep
      up my boyish figure. I am probably best in a home with older kids. Oh and I
      forgot, I can only be adopted out to a home outside the Sioux City limits. I

    Description: Where do I start describing a coon hound?  Well this one is a beautiful
      black and Tan Coon hound close to 2 years old.  Her name is Harley and she is
      looking for a family.  She has gained some, but still thin and loves her food.  She
      is on the list for her spaying in the near future, unless her new owner wants
      to take on that responsibility.  Her adoption cost will then reflect a discount.<br>Harley
      gets along fine with large male dogs, but we don't feel that she will do well
      with other females.  So, having said that, being the only dog would probably
      be best.<br>Harley is a sweet gal though and would make a good family pet.  She
      hasn't had the opportunity for house training but being the smart gal that she
      is, it shouldn't take long.<br>Call if interested   402-846-5100

    Description: Meet Marvin--that's his name for now. Beautiful dog with very handsome
      markings.  Marvin was a surrender, and will be going to the Vet this week to
      be neutered and complete the rest of his vaccinations. Just wanted you to meet
      him in case he is just the right dog that you are looking for.  We are guessing
      him at 12 months of age.  <br>He hasn't been here long, so getting to know more
      about him.  Marvin is a large dog and I suspect a great running or jogging partner.  Call

      funny, goofy and ador-a-bull. I am your total family companion. I get very attached
      to my humans so it would be pawsome if I had a family that were not gone a lot.
      I am great with kids of all ages. My dream is to have a little boy or girl who
      wants to play with me. They can throw the ball and I will always bring it back.
      I love belly rubs and to give kisses. I am just a happy dog all around. Sadly,
      I am not allowed in the Sioux City limits. I don't know why but I do no it is
      a very silly reason. Please, if you are looking for a buddy, a best friend,
      a dog for your family...look no further, Target here, I'm your boy!

    Description: Oh my--April is such a beautiful Husky--and full of love and energy.  She
      is waiting for a family that has the time and the love to share with her.  April
      is almost a year old now and has been spayed and has all vaccinations.  She
      is a very sweet dog and typical of most huskies has lots of energy.</p><p>April
      isn't house trained yet, because she hasn't had the opportunity living in a
      kennel.  She is very smart though and could be trained easily.  Because April
      is a husky and the breed likes to roam---a big fenced in yard is a requirement.  Of
      course even better would be a family that takes her for walks daily.</p><p>She
      is around 40# and still growing.Call if you are interested in this beautiful
      gal. 402-846-5100

    Description: Teddy here, as in Teddy Bear. I am your play buddy. Yep, I like to
      walk, run, play ball, hike, and I love outdoor adventures...I am basically a
      package of fun. I need a home where I can't climb a fence. Yes I can get over
      a fence so I cannot go to a home that is going to keep me outdoors unattended.
      But I am just fine inside next to you chilling out. My main breed is Akita which
      means I am very loyal to my family and will be there for you always. I play
      nicely with other dogs and I like kids too. Remember that teddy bear you loved
      and hugged as a kid? Well I am that bear in dogs clothing.

    Description: 'Description of pet<br>What a gorgeous gal Elsa is! She is 4 years
      old and has the most beautiful white coat to boot.<br>Elsa arrived here after
      being in a shelter that euthanizes. Her friend Nico found his home--now it is
      her turn.<br>Huskies are a different breed and many require special handling.
      That is true with Elsa. A great house dog were were told, but huskies have a
      tendency to roam and that is what she did. Elsa needs a family that fit all
      the requirements and is knowledgeable about this breed.</p><p>We are hoping
      to find a family that will work with Elsa and help give her the life she deserves.
      Here is more more information about her.<br>Elsa has been spayed and has all
      her vaccinations.</p><p>1. She will need a tall fenced in area. A privacy (wooden
      fence would be the best). Or a large kennel<br>2. Elsa does not do well with
      any small animals. So no puppies, cats, no farm animals at all.</p><p>HOWEVER,
      SHE LOVES PEOPLE AND COULD BE A GREAT FAMILY DOG, FOR THE RIGHT FAMILY. Call
      402-846-5100 if you can meet these requirements and know about Huskies/Malamutes.UPDATE:  She
      went for a ride with Chuck on our 4wd Mule.  She had a wonderful time. He said
      she loves to ride and just needs a family that can give her the love and attention
      she craves.</p><p>Characteristics<br>-<br>Internal notes'

    Description: Lover Boy! He has come so far since the first day here. He was full
      of sores and bites, and looked like he had been used for a bait dog.  He was
      very scared of us at first, but quickly grew to trust us and share his kisses.<br>Lover
      boy is a unique looking guy--he is medium build, we are now thinking he may
      be a Shar Pei miix, maybe with Doberman, because of his markings.<br>He needs
      a family that can show him special love, attention and training. He should probably
      be the only dog.   We believe he is over 5 years of age.<br>He really is a lover
      boy, and I didn't give up on him.  Hoping that there is a family that will give
      him just what he needs. He loves going for walks.<br>Did I tell you that when
      we wags his tail, his whole body moves. Lover Boy is now    neutered and we
      want a very special home for this boy. Photos soon<br>Call 402-846-5100 if you
      are interested.

    Description: 'Bogie is a delightful, dapper almost 11 year old (birth date of
      9-20-08) gentleman of a beagle mix.  True to his hound dog nature, he is a very
      sweet boy and loves to adventure outdoors. He is friendly with men, women and
      children (8+).  Bogie is house trained, walks very nicely on a leash,  and is
      a total love bug.  He does sit, stay and come for treats :D(but sometimes not,
      if you don''t have treats ;) )  He has gotten along with other large dogs after
      a slow introduction, but isn''t good with overwhelming experiences like a dog
      park.   Bogie is about 50 pounds.      </p><p>Unlike our cats, we try to have
      our dogs in foster homes throughout the week. If a dog is in a foster home,
      they come in on Saturdays from 11:00am to 4:00pm. Arrangements can be made to
      have specific dogs brought in during the week- just give us a call or email
      to see if the dog you are interested in is in a foster home and set up a meeting
      time if necessary.</p><p>Our adoption fees include the following: all of our
      dogs/puppies are current on vaccinations (DHPP and Rabies if over 3 months of
      age) at the point of adoption, dewormed, heartworm tested and current on preventative,
      treated for fleas/ticks and are spayed or neutered. Our large dog adoption fee
      is generally $125.00 + tax. Our small dog and puppy adoption fee is generally
      $160.00 + tax. Adoption fees may vary in special circumstances. Due to space
      limitations, we do not hold dogs.</p><p>You also have the option to microchip
      your new dog/puppy for only $20 + tax. Brookings city pet licenses are also
      available for purchase for those living in Brookings, SD.</p><p>Because we are
      on a busy street, we require that all dogs leaving the shelter be in a carrier
      or on leash. All pets remain up for adoption until an approved application is
      processed and their adoption fee paid.'

      out) she likes to pose for pictures.<br>Both her and sister Cheech came to the
      rescue this summer and have had all their vaccinations completed. We are thinking
      they are now close to a year. She is on the list to be spayed, just waiting
      for the schedule to work out.<br>Because of their breed, we find they are very
      active and should probably be in a home without small children, cats, or other
      females.   They need a family that can give them the training and attention
      they so need.  Chong looks more red heeler! She is so pretty and loves attention.  Call

    Description: Luna is a special girl to us, see she is a tad different but that
      is what makes her so unique and wonderful! She is a young girl at about 2 years
      old, just freshly considered an adult with a teenager attitude and a toddlers
      get up and go play style. This girl is a tall, slender and muscular girl who
      needs an active family or a job to do to keep her energy manageable, she strives
      to please you. When she is not chewing on a bone, running around the yard, begging
      you to take her on a walk (and yes she will carry her leash around the house
      until you take her!) Lu likes her stuffed unicorn, which will go to her new
      home with her, she carries it everywhere she can and sleeps with it in her kennel.
      We do not know her past as she was a rescue transfer after being pulled out
      of a kill shelter, we aren't bothered by not knowing her past because we know
      her present and future are a warm, cozy and forever loved one. <br>This sweet
      girl is good with kids and loves to clean their faces after they make a mess
      from lunch snacks. Due to her play style and her size/strength she may knock
      small ones that are unsteady on their feet down unintentionally. Being dog selective
      makes it a little more difficult for playdates but her preferences are set,
      meaning we will NOT place her in a home that does not take dog selective dog
      seriously and understand to the fullest she may not get along with a particular
      dog. We are unsure of cats but the small amount of time she has shown her foster
      parents that she is too curious about small critters to make us comfortable
      enough to place her in a home with one. If you are a fun, outgoing, active family
      then Luna is your girl!

    Description: Our Sweet BREEZE is also still waiting for her forever home and family
      !! This girl just loves people and was so excited to get the attention and to
      get out in the snow to play, that she didn't care what we put on her to wear.
      Ha ha !! Breeze loves people and we would love to see her on a farm or a country
      home / acreage. She has had to be independent in her short life that we would
      love to see her have the freedom to roam and explore. Once she knew this was
      her new home and had people to love and care for her, we are sure she would
      stay close by. Breeze is a spay, one and a half year old Chocolate Lab cross
      Shepherd female. If you would like to come and meet her and spend some time
      with her, she is at the rescue in Gregory, SD 605-835-8780

    Description: This fireball is the sweetest dog you could ever ask for. She will
      be 3 in October and has a lot of puppy left in her. She loves children and jumping
      on the trampoline with them. She is learning her leash manners, loves to walk
      and go running. She is quick to catching on to commands. She does know how to
      sit and stay. She is looking for an active family who will include her in all
      their activities. She loves water as you can see her dipping her paws in the
      water bucket in one of the posted pics.  Awnie will be spayed before an adoption
      takes place.  If you feel Awnie would make a great addition to your family give
      us a call at 402-336-5435.

    Description: Sweet Marcella, she is perfect in every way it is a shock how she
      is not only still with us but has never had genuine interest in making her a
      forever family member. She is fully house trained and crate trained so no messes,
      minus the here and theres she may have while adjusting. She does great with
      other dogs and cats are no mind for her. Children, oh gosh, kids are her forte
      like they are her personal ones, even though she has never had a litter. If
      you want a girl who would love time to run off energy, a girl who wants to be
      the princess in your castle she is awaiting for her king and queen to find her!

    Description: Fit Bit originally came from Chicago as a confiscation when he was
      found with 3 other dogs containing bite wounds. Mr Bit was awarded to the city
      after being held as owners prisoner for unknown amount of time. He enjoys rolling
      in the grass and loves nothing more to chase the ball and then watch it stay
      still, he hasn't mastered bringing it back yet. He is so loving and can be quite
      the attention hog and loves all other dogs he has met so far. He still has some
      learning to do with proper play etiquette. He plays like a 6 week old puppy
      in a full grown body at times. Fun and love is his middle namr, he also likes
      to stay active! Fit Bit is looking for a home with older kids, his excitement
      will knock small ones over. We haven't tested him with cats so it is unknown
      how he would do.

    Description: 'Hello there my name is Eliot and I am an 8 month old, 55 pound lab
      mix. I was adopted and then returned because I ended up being a little too much
      for the family. I am a very sweet boy and I know how to sit. I am very active
      and love walks and all kinds of adventures. I am still a puppy so I do need
      help with my manners but I am very smart so it shouldn''t take too long! I did
      live on a farm so I will need to be taught how to not go potty in the house.
      Sometimes I can be a bit jumpy but with some guidance and being corrected I
      will stop that in no time. I love everyone but due to my jumyness and excitement
      I may knock little ones over. I have not been around other dogs but I do not
      show signs of aggression towards any here at the shelter. I did chase the farm
      cats at my previous home so a home without cats would probably be best fit for
      me. I am in the shelter scouting out potential forever homes that can teach
      me how to be the best pup I can be. I am looking for someone that is willing
      to give me the exercise and training I need to be a well mannered boy. I am
      already neutered, micro chipped and up to date on all of my vaccinations so
      next step is a forever home :) My adoption fee is $213.00</p><p>Most of our
      dogs are currently in shelter - but some are in foster homes. If you would like
      to see a specific dog, feel free to contact us to see if they are in shelter
      or in foster care! Dogs in shelter are available to visit or adopt daily. IF
      a dog is in a foster home, they come in on Saturdays from 11:00am to 4:00pm.
      Arrangements can be made to have specific dogs brought in during the week- just
      give us a call or email to see if the dog you are interested in is in a foster
      home and set up a meeting time if necessary.</p><p>Our adoption fees include
      the following: all of our dogs/puppies are current on vaccinations (DHPP and
      Rabies if over 3 months of age) at the point of adoption, dewormed, heartworm
      tested and current on preventative, microchipped, treated for fleas/ticks and
      are spayed or neutered. Our large dog adoption fee is generally $150 + tax.
      Our small dog and puppy adoption fee is generally $200 + tax. Adoption fees
      may vary in special circumstances. Due to space limitations, we do not hold
      dogs.</p><p>Because we are on a busy street, we require that all dogs leaving
      the shelter be in a carrier or on leash. All pets remain up for adoption until
      an approved application is processed and their adoption fee paid. Adoptions
      will stop a half hour before we close, at 5:30pm M-F and 3:30pm Saturday.'

    Description: 'Hello my name is Carmichael! I am a 4-5 year old, 21 pound chihuahua
      mix. I came to the shelter because my owner had too many animals. I am very
      friendly and have enjoyed every visitor that has come to say hi. I am a little
      under socialized so someone who is patient and understands my situation would
      be best for me. I am not yet house trained but I''m sure I would catch on quickly.
      I have been getting along with one other dog I came in with but sometimes I
      was not so nice to the other ones so if you have a dog a meet and greet is suggested!
      I am in the shelter scouting out potential adopters that will understand my
      situation. I am a very good boy and always try my best to please. Since coming
      to the shelter I have been neutered, micro chipped and up to date on my vaccinations.

    Description: Gunner is a sweet 3 yr old girl who loves to run, enjoys her romps
      around the yard and walking with our volunteers. She is kennel/house trained
      and will greet you with a big smile and a little jump. She has a high prey drive
      so a home with small animals is a no go. We are still testing her with other
      dogs to see how she fairs with them so as of right now a home with no other
      dogs would be best. <br>Gunner is very active and would do well in a home with
      children and a family that has the patience and knowledge for a dog who may
      be hard of hearing. We have done a few tests and the lower pitched sounds she
      seems to either ignore or does not hear. Gunner girl will be spayed before an
      adoption takes place.

    Description: <p>Max is a purebred Pomeranian. He has been on a diet since coming
      to rescue, and has now reached his ideal weight of 9 pounds. He has a beautiful
      blonde coat.</p>  <p>Max is current on all his vaccinations and has been neutered.
      Max tested negative for heart worm and is on preventative. He gets along very
      well with all the dogs.&nbsp; He is also super with the cats. Max is crate trained
      and house trained. Max was surrendered to rescue because he likes to mark his
      territory. This can be addressed in a couple different ways - both involving
      consistency and patience. He is doing well here. Max needs a home with a lot
      of love, someone who will play with him, and is willing to brush him.</p>  <p>K9HAVEN
      Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)3 not for profit rescue. Your donation for Max&#39;s
      $75 adoption fee is tax deductible. K9HAVEN Rescue requires a fenced yard (no
      underground fencing, please) an adoption application, personal and vet references,
      home visit and an adoption contract. Max will not be placed in a home with very
      young children. Please contact us if you have any questions about Max.</p><img

      My name is Dax. I came to Dakota Dachshund Rescue because my mom couldn''t take
      care of me anymore. I was hit by a car many years ago, my pelvis was crushed.
      I healed and was able to walk again because my mom took such good care of me.
      I can be a little sensitive when picked up, I have learned to trust my foster
      mom but it took a week for me to trust her not to hurt me. Dr Paul did xrays
      and assessed my pelvis, I may need arthritis meds or pain meds. I do fine with
      all the other dogs in my foster home.&nbsp;<br />I love blankets....blankets
      on the couch, blankets in the bed, blankets in my kennel!<br /><br />Can you
      be my furever home? I am 10 years old, I weigh 13.6 lbs, my adoption fee is

    Description: <font color=red>You can fill out an adoption application online on
      our official website.</font><br><br><strong>Please contact Nadene for more information
      about this pet.</strong><p>Hi! My name is Bella and I would love to play fetch
      with you.</p> <p>I am incredibly treat and toy oriented. Sometimes I get stuck
      in my foster mom&rsquo;s toy basket trying to unpack all the toys in an afternoon
      and end up crying for help. I really enjoy walks, fetching, and showing off
      my new tricks. My foster mom is working with me to learn new commands and thinks
      that I am very smart.</p> <p>I am a bit protective. Sometimes this trait is
      great&mdash;I alert people in the house when someone&rsquo;s coming, but sometimes
      it means that I don&rsquo;t share my bed, toys, or foster mom very well. I came
      to live with my foster mom, because I couldn&rsquo;t get along with the toddler
      in my house and I have some behavioral problems that I&rsquo;m working to fix.
      I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress in a short time with my foster mom, who would
      be happy to talk to you about me.</p> <p>I am currently staying at a house with
      two dogs (one young and one old) and a cat. In the time I&rsquo;ve been here,
      I&rsquo;ve adjusted to sharing the toys (most of the time) and the dog beds
      (sometimes) and the cat and I can hang around each other. Like I said before,
      I&rsquo;m smart and know that not sharing means I don&rsquo;t get to have that
      thing, so I give up and walk away without complaint. It&rsquo;s my first time
      in a house with a cat, so sometimes I forget that I&rsquo;m not supposed to
      chase her. I&rsquo;ve only been practicing this for a month and have gotten
      really good at remembering, unless I&rsquo;m tired, then I turn into a pumpkin.</p>
      <p>I would be really happy in a home without children, lots of toys, and a warm
      bed&mdash;preferably your bed. I&rsquo;m not very big, so I won&rsquo;t take
      up much space.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>PS. My bedtime is 9:30, I hope yours is,
      too.</p> <br /> <div class='OutlineElement Ltr  BCX0 SCXW130714616'> <p class='Paragraph

    Description: Maxwell Angel was welcomed to B-Squad after being surrendered when
      his family was moving and could only take one dog with them. Max was really
      struggling with his hips when he first arrived to rescue, but after some x-rays,
      medication, and a good grooming, he looks and feels like a whole new ma who
      is ready to enjoy his golden years in a loving home! Maxwell is housetrained
      and gets along great with dogs, cats, and people of all ages.<br/><br/>Maxwell
      will be looking for a forever home with few stairs so that it is easier for
      him to get around. He will need to be on anti-inflammatories and supplements
      for his hips for the rest of his life to help him get around without pain. Maxwell&#39;s
      adoption fee is $400. He is neutered, up to date on monthly vaccinations, preventatives,
      and is microchipped. Please visit our website at bsquaddogrescue.com to review

      I''m Barney.<br /> I am a very happy boy, I like being with my person.<br />
      I can get a tad protective if you allow me to, I just want to protect the ones
      I love, which is pretty typical for a dachshund.<br />I''m a big explorer so
      I need a fenced yard so I don''t wander off following my nose and get lost.<br
      /><br />I go in for a dental on Valentine''s Day. Dr Paul wants to look at a
      couple other things medically before DDR lets me go to a new home of my own.<br
      />Update 3/3/2018 I am feeling very good now that I have had a dental and a
      couple of bad teeth pulled. Dr Paul says the spot on my liver they saw on ultrasound
      was like a big blood blister and the tissue samples came back as normal liver
      cells....YAY! I will be ready to go to a furever home of my own after I get
      my oral sutures rechecked next week.<br /><br />I am good with other dogs, I
      am a food hound so you must feed me on a schedule and measured amounts. I can
      be food aggressive with other dogs.<br />I lived with an elderly woman until
      she had to go to the nursing home, I then lived on the farm with a couple that
      loved me very much but I started getting too protective of them and they felt
      they couldn''t keep me anymore.&nbsp;<br />I need boundaries and to be walked
      on a leash.<br />I will run after people and nip at their ankles to protect
      my people and my space.<br /><br />Are you that special person for me?<br />My
      name is Barney, I am 11 years old, <br />weigh 16 lbs, <br />my adoption fee
      is $175 plus sales tax $7.88= $182.88&nbsp;</span><br><br><a href=''https://dakotadachshundrescue.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=12645468''
